# TurboEndlessRunner
Game made using Unity3d

#While making this project I've learned:
###How to use delegate and event keywords
I've created simple game event handlet class which helped me with understanding basics of delegate keyword.

###How to use Queues
I've already known some collections but I haven't ever possibility to use Queue, in other projects I prefer to use Lists over raw arrays.
